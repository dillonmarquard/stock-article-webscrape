According to its public statements, Tesla intends to hire 3,000 more people across two new facilities eventually. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Tesla’s plans expand the company’s manufacturing footprint beyond the property it is already developing outside of Reno in Sparks, Nevada. Tesla said in a statement that its new facilities will include a 100 GWh battery cell factory, where the company expects to have the capacity to produce battery cells for 2 million light duty vehicles annually, and a high-volume factory where it will eventually manufacture its class 8 heavy-duty, fully electric truck, the Tesla Semi. Tesla began construction of its first battery factory in Nevada in 2014. It operates this plant today with a key cell supplier, co-tenant and co-investor in the factory, Panasonic. The sprawling factory is known as GF1, Giga Nevada or the original Tesla Gigafactory. It primarily manufactures and supplies Tesla’s Fremont, California, vehicle assembly plant with high-voltage battery packs. Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo revealed details about Tesla’s plans for expansion in the state early on Monday. Tesla confirmed the plans on Tuesday ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings update, which is scheduled for Wednesday after markets close. Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a ceremony in Nevada in December to kick off deliveries of the company’s Tesla Semi to a key early customer, PepsiCo. Tesla first announced its plans to produce the Semi in 2017, and had a targeted start of production in 2019 that was delayed until 2022. The company is not yet manufacturing a high volume of Semi trucks, but is making some at the Nevada Gigafactory. Fans and critics of Tesla have been posting images of Tesla Semi trucks emblazoned with Pepsi Frito Lay branding that they’ve seen on the road since that announcement, including some broken down on the shoulder. Tesla Semi trucks emblazoned with Pepsi Frito Lay branding Tesla has yet to reveal publicly how much each truck costs, and did not say how many it has produced or sold in its fourth-quarter deliveries report. fourth-quarter deliveries report. The company is expected to share further details on its Semi program in its Q4 earnings call. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

       "  'text': 'Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionalsLearn more about Musk ends ’funding secured’ testimony without citing binding Tesla deal [1/5] Tesla CEO Elon Musk is questioned by his attorney Alex Spiro during a securities-fraud trial at federal court in San Francisco, California, U.S., January 24, 2023 in this courtroom sketch. REUTERS/Vicki Behringer Read More SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk testified on Tuesday that he expected strong financial support when he tweeted that he would take the electric car maker private in 2018, but admitted he lacked specific commitments from potential backers. Musk ended three days on the stand defending against claims that he defrauded investors by tweeting on Aug. 7, 2018, that he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla private. The trial in San Francisco federal court is testing whether the world’s second-richest person can be held liable for his sometimes impulsive use of Twitter. Musk told a jury that he could have drawn upon several sources of financing to take Tesla private, from existing shareholders like Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) co-founder Larry Ellison to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund or his own fortune. \"Funding was absolutely not an issue,\" Musk said. \"It was quite the opposite.\" Musk, however, acknowledged he did not have binding agreements with investors, leaving it to the jury to decide if he misled shareholders. Musk remained generally subdued and calm during his testimony, which began on Friday. Near the end of nearly nine total hours on the stand, he became more combative, making comments about the class action law firm that brought the case. His comments were struck from the record by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen. Tesla’s stock surged after Musk’s 2018 tweet about the $420 per share price, which was a premium of about 23% to the prior day’s close, only to fall as it became clear the buyout would not happen. Investors say they lost millions of dollars as a result. A jury of nine will decide whether the Tesla CEO artificially inflated the company’s share price by touting the buyout’s prospects, and if so, by how much. Musk testified on Tuesday in response to questions from his lawyer Alex Spiro that his tweet was intended to inform investors about his interest in taking Tesla private. Musk said he had already discussed his interest with the Tesla board and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, and he feared it would leak to the media. \"I had no ill motive,\" he said. \"My intent here was to do the right thing for shareholders.\" The Saudi fund did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Musk told the jury he decided to drop the idea of taking the company private after getting feedback from shareholders. \"After talking to a number of investors, especially the smaller investors, they said they would prefer a Tesla that remained public and I felt it was important to be responsive to their wishes,\" Musk testified. The jury was shown notes and documents from a board meeting in the days after the tweet at which Goldman Sachs (GS.N), which was working with Musk on the proposed deal, had indicated there would be more than enough funding to take the company private. Goldman Sachs did not immediately reply to a request for comment. But when questioned by Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the investors, Musk said he did not have binding agreements for financing from any interested party. Musk repeatedly resisted the \"yes\" or \"no\" responses sought by Porritt about discussions over funding pledges by the Saudi fund, prompting the judge at one point to help with the questioning. \"Was a specific number discussed, not concepts?\" Chen asked. \"Not a specific number,\" Musk said. On Monday, Musk said he could have financed the deal by selling his stake in SpaceX, the aerospace company where he is also chief executive officer. He has also said he believed financing had been pledged by Saudi representatives of the Public Investment Fund, before they backpedaled. The trial is scheduled to continue into next week with testimony by Tesla board members and experts. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

If true, the move would go against previously announced plans. The governor made the comment during his inaugural State of the State speech: I am looking forward to joining Elon Musk and the team at Tesla tomorrow when they unveil plans to build a brand-new $3.5 billion-dollar advanced manufacturing facility in northern Nevada for the company’s all-electric semi-trucks. He didn’t elaborate beyond that, but the comment is fairly straightforward: The governor seems to confirm that Tesla plans to announce a new $3.5 billion factory to produce the Tesla Semi. The announcement would come as soon as today – a day before Tesla’s earnings announcement. Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near Gigafactory Nevada. At the time, we were told that the production equipment installed would be for about five electric trucks per week. Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi in a new building near Gigafactory Nevada When launching the production version of the Tesla Semi, the company confirmed that it is where they are being built. For volume production, Tesla has previously signaled plans to build the electric semi-truck in higher volume at Gigafactory Texas. It seems everyone is announcing new $3B, $4B, or $5B factories. An article last week claimed $210B in new EV and EV battery factories have been announced in the U.S. since Biden took office! (Now, we just have to cross our fingers that everything announced get built.) Any new $3.5B EV factory is great news, but it’s no longer a \"game changer\" like it would have been just a few years ago. Now, a new $3.5B EV factory is just the cost of becoming/remaining competitive. A new large $3.5 billion factory in Northern Nevada would be a change of plan. Also, Tesla already has a large factory in Northern Nevada, and it is not even complete yet. It would be strange to invest in another large facility – unless the governor meant that Tesla is going to invest $3.5 billion in the production of Tesla Semi at the existing Gigafactory Nevada plant. Coincidently, we reported just a few months ago that Tesla finally started to plan the expansion of the Gigafactory Nevada building after years of inactivity on that front. The new expansion could potentially be to support that new production of the Tesla Semi. Tesla finally started to plan the expansion of the Gigafactory Nevada building We should know in the next few hours. We will keep you updated when we have more information.

       "  'text': 'Electrek Logo Go to the Electrek home page Space Explored LogoSpace Explored Electric Vehicle Price Guide – best prices for dealers in the US Tesla (TSLA) Q4 and full year 2022 preview: Here’s what to expect Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q4 2022 and full-year 2022 financial results on Wednesday, January 25, after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management are scheduled after the results. Here we’ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results. As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q4 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company’s revenue. Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 405,000 electric vehicles during the fourth quarter of the year. it delivered just over 405,000 electric vehicles during the fourth quarter of the year This is a delivery record for Tesla, but the automaker actually came significantly below expectations. There was also a record discrepancy between vehicles produced and vehicles delivered. Tesla produced 439,000 vehicles during the quarter. Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results. For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $24.669 billion, and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $24.879 billion. This would be a record quarter for revenue, thanks to the record deliveries, but it’s hard to estimate due to Tesla offering some significant discounts in December. Here are the predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now. For Q4 2022, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $1.13 per share, while Estimize’s prediction is higher with a profit of $1.19 per share. The estimates have a wide range this quarter because of the discounts that Tesla offered in December. It most likely significantly impacted gross margins, but it’s hard to say by how much without knowing how many cars Tesla delivered last month. The automaker also had over 30,000 vehicles in inventory or transit at the end of the quarter, which is also going to impact earnings negatively. Here are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: Other expectations for the TSLA shareholder’s letter and analyst call In the shareholder’s letter and the following conference call, Tesla generally shares additional details about not only financial results, but also other important metrics on how the company is doing. CEO Elon Musk is not always on the call, but this time, he is expected to be since it’s not only the Q4 earnings but also the full 2022 earnings. Tesla will continue to expand at about 50% y/y for a couple of more years, then rate will decline yearly (as it gets exponentially harder to keep up a 50% pace) until they get to 10-20 million/yr in 2030-35. Utility / residential battery packs / virtual power-plants will be as big or bigger than cars by then and FSD / robots / the machine that makes the machine .. will be a thing. This is in motion now and only time/effort stand in the way .. world events notwithstanding. Generally, the full-year earnings are also when a company releases guidance for the new year, but Tesla is not like most companies. Tesla has consistently just reiterated its intention to remain marginally profitable as it reinvests into its business and aims for about 50% growth in deliveries per year. However, the automaker generally shares its planned capital expenditure for the year, so we can expect that. Interestingly, Tesla recently announced a new “Investor Day” in March that sounds a lot like an earnings conference call or an annual shareholder meeting, so it’s possible that Tesla keeps some of the more juicy stuff that would have been said at the earnings for this Investor Day.

Learn More Tesla is cutting prices on its most popular models. What does this mean for the company and its shareholders? Tesla’s (TSLA -4.31%) stock price has bounced back somewhat from its recent lows, but was recently battered after the automaker cut prices of its most popular models, the Model Y and Model 3. It started late last year, with the carmaker offering $7,500 incentives to Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV purchasers in a move to lower inventory. The company then took things a step further by giving buyers of any Tesla delivered in the final three days of 2022 three months of the Full Self-Driving option for free. In China, an incentive of as much as 10,000 Chinese yuan was extended, and for the second time in less than three months, prices were cut by as much as 13.5%. Now comes word that Tesla cut the Model Y’s price in the United States to $52,990, a reduction of about 20%, and the Model 3’s price was reduced to $53,990, a 14% discount. Tesla cut the Model Y’s price in the United States Tesla has reduced pricing in Europe as well, with the Model 3 and Model Y costing up to 17% less in Germany, and as much as 22% less in Italy. Tesla also cut prices of those models’ prices in Austria, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Tesla has reduced pricing in Europe as well And in China, Tesla continues to offer a 6,000 yen subsidy, and is offering a 4,000 yen incentive related to buying insurance through Tesla in November. Reduced prices bring with them reduced profit margins. But that’s not as bad as it sounds. Tesla’s gross profit margin runs around 25%, giving the company wiggle room to support market share by dropping prices. Most mainstream automakers run closer to those of General Motors, which operates with a profit margin of less than 7%. In the U.S., the new lower prices will allow more customers to take advantage of the $7,500 federal tax benefits available for electric vehicles (EVs) that cost less than $55,000. Lower prices will also make these aging models more competitive against an onslaught of new models from other automakers, with some, like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, slated to start at less than $30,000, significantly less than any Tesla. While Chevrolet isn’t a direct Tesla competitor, the arrival of more EV options does mean that Tesla might have to surrender some profit to maintain market share, which last year hovered at 65.4% of the EV market, down from 79.4% two years before. Certainly, the price cuts appear to be working in China, where local media reports 30,000 vehicles have been sold since the company announced the lower prices. The reduced prices could have the same effect in the U.S., where the company faces few competitors -- for now. But that could change; a J.D. Power study recently revealed that 44% of likely EV buyers would consider a Chevrolet EV, 37% a Ford, and 39% a Tesla. For now, it’s best to hang on to the stock, as it’s starting to rise from its recent lows. But adding to the stock in the short term is not be advisable until its volatility settles down.

The other factory will make new battery cells, called 4680, and have the capacity to make enough batteries for 2 million light-duty vehicles annually. Together, the plants will employ about 3,000 people. The Elon Musk-led company’s existing complex in the city of Sparks makes lithium-ion batteries, vehicle parts and other products such as Powerwall, a power backup system for consumers. Unveiled in 2017, the Semi was initially expected to go into production in 2019 but its first delivery was delayed to December, when Musk handed a vehicle to PepsiCo. The move marked Tesla’s first foray into the trucking business. Elon Musk testified in a California courtroom for a third day in the Tesla shareholder lawsuit on January 24.

It may qualify for tax credits of $40,000 offered for clean commercial vehicles under the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August. Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said in November that Tesla might produce 100 Semis in 2022, but the company did not disclose any figure in its fourth-quarter production report. The EV maker aims to produce 50,000 of the trucks in 2024, Musk had said on a post-earnings call in October. PepsiCo plans to roll out 100 Semis in 2023.

Gitlin - 4/3/2023, 6:13 AM reader comments 390 with Sales of new Tesla electric vehicles rose for the first quarter of 2023, according to sales and production figures released by the EV maker on Sunday. For the three months between the start of the year and the end of March, Tesla delivered 422,875 EVs; in 2022, they managed 310,048 deliveries during Q1. That represents a 36 percent increase year on year for the EV company and a 4 percent increase from Q4 2022. As expected, the vast majority of its sales were split between the Models 3 and Y—Tesla does not break out details any further, nor does it report by regions. In Q1 2023, it delivered 412,180 Models 3 and Y, 5 percent of which were leased. The recent price cuts may have helped shift some metal—despite some yo-yoing up and down, a Model Y is $11,000 cheaper today than at the start of the year. a Model Y is $11,000 cheaper today than at the start of the year A counterpoint to that argument can be found by looking at how the aging Models S and X are doing. The answer? Not great. Substantial price cuts in January and March do not appear to have moved the needle (at least not in the right direction), and Tesla delivered almost 50 percent fewer of these EVs—just 10,695—for the first quarter of this year than the first three months of last year. In fact, Tesla was left with almost as many Models S and X on hand as it could sell, building 19,437 for Q1 2023. A similar number of Models 3 and Y were built but left unsold as well. This is becoming a growing problem for Tesla. In Q1 2022, it sold 5,000 more EVs than it built. In Q1 2023, it built 18,000 more EVs than it could sell, which we can add to the 56,000 unsold EVs it reported at the end of 2022. which we can add to the 56,000 unsold EVs it reported at the end of 2022 In presenting its 2022 financial results, Tesla said it expects to grow sales by 50 percent and will sell 1.8 million cars this year, although CEO Elon Musk has been more ambitious. But to achieve those goals, the company will need to ramp sales much higher for the rest of the year if it doesn’t want to disappoint investors again. disappoint investors again How The Callisto Protocol’s Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio reader comments 390 with April 3, 2023 at 2:03 pm Today on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative Director of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential (and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated racing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for XBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer learning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the AI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza Motorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened.

But Wall Street forecasts Tesla 2023 per-share earnings shrinking compared with 2022. With Tesla preparing to release first-quarter 2023 delivery and production data in early April, Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote Monday he expects a \"modest\" deliveries beat. Wall Street expects around 430,000 Tesla deliveries. \"Concerns have built on the pace of deliveries amid weakening demand signals. However, we believe commentary on the pace of production likely implies some upside, which we assume will be ~430k units in the quarter,\" Levy wrote. \"Assuming production only modestly outpaces deliveries (a reasonable assumption, as there was already a large inventory build in 4Q22), it supports upside results vs. consensus,\" he added. Levy wrote that if Tesla deliveries are better than expected, it \"could be a catalyst for the stock, as expectations have come down amid signs of softening demand.\" Barclays maintains an \"Overweight\" rating and a 275 price target for Tesla stock. Citigroup (C) analyst Itay Michaeli on Monday raised the price target on Tesla stock to 192, up from 146. Michaeli maintained a \"Neutral\" rating on Tesla shares. Michaeli wrote the EV company’s auto gross margins will give investors a a first look at the impact of Tesla’s price cuts. However, he added the firm doubts Tesla will beat delivery estimates. Tesla stock surged 3.4% early before reversing. TSLA shares closed up 0.7% to 191.77 Monday during market trade. Shares edged down 0.94% to 190.41 Friday. Analysts predict Tesla deliveries to total 430,000 in the first quarter, according to FactSet. This would represent a 39% increase compared to the 310,000 deliveries for the same period in 2022. Wall Street forecasts Tesla deliveries in 2023 to come in around 1.8 million. Analysts also now expect Tesla full-year earnings to contract compared to 2022. Wall Street predicts earnings sliding around 3% to $3.96 a share in 2023, down from $4.07 per share in 2022. Tesla sold 140,453 China-made vehicles in the first two months of the year. The global EV giant exported 57% of those vehicles to Europe and elsewhere. Meanwhile, Tesla’s lowest-priced vehicle, the Model 3, may lose eligibility to the new $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit at the end of March. Last week, Electrek reported Tesla told employees it expects to lose the credit because the battery comes from China. Model 3, may lose eligibility Tesla deliveries hit a record 405,278 in the fourth quarter of 2022, jumping 31% vs. a year earlier and nearly 18% vs. the third quarter’s 343,830. Deliveries swelled 40% to 1,313,851 in 2022, but well below the company’s 50% increase goal. Analysts had expected fourth-quarter Tesla deliveries of roughly 420,000. record 405,278 in the fourth quarter of 2022 Since March 13, Tesla stock has gained around 10% even as the failures of SVB Financial, Signature Bank of New York and Credit Suisse (CS) trigger worries of broader financial instability. At Monday’s market close, Tesla stock was down around 6.7% on the month. Prior the bank failures, Tesla sold off hard from March 6 to 10, falling 12.3%. However, Tesla stock found support at its 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Tesla stock is still forging a bottoming base, below the 200-day line. But that key level is now below the potential 217.75 buy point. With Tesla deliveries data expected early next week, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Tesla’s credit rating by one notch to Baa3, giving it investment-grade status from a prior junk rating. S&P Global did the same in October. An investment grade from at least two major credit ratings agencies is considered important. Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Tesla’s credit rating Moody’s wrote last week the EV giant’s outlook is stable and that it expects free cash flow of more than $7 billion and limited debt through 2025. \"Tesla will remain one of the foremost manufacturers of battery electric vehicles with an expanding global presence and very high profitability,\" Moody’s wrote. TSLA stock ranks third in IBD’s Auto Manufacturers industry group. Tesla has a 86 Composite Rating out of 99. The stock also has a 69 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating is 99.

Here is a look at the stock’s rocky 2022, the issues the company is facing and whether the current rise in stock price can be sustained moving forward—plus, how Q.ai can help. Automaker Tesla had a wild year in 2022 as its CEO, Elon Musk, thought it was prudent to take questionable actions that tanked the company’s stock value. Before that, Tesla was a darling among well-heeled auto buyers who wanted to do their part to help the environment. Until that point, the most controversial aspect of Tesla was its build quality and exorbitant cost of repairs on older models. Buyers were more than willing to overlook these issues until Musk bought Twitter and used it as a megaphone for his personal views. However, that’s not the only problem Tesla faced. Best Travel Insurance Companies Best Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans Tesla forecasted 50% growth at the start of 2022, but that goal proved challenging as the company became plagued by labor issues and a CEO who decided he could say anything he wanted without consequences. It opened its newest factory in Germany in March but had difficulties attracting enough employees to fill all of the open roles.

Even though the increase in production is notable, Wall Street analysts were expecting more. Will Bristol Myers SquibbStock Rise Post Q1? Q4 of 2022 saw the most pressure on the company as coronavirus outbreaks in China slowed production, deep price cuts on existing models were offered, weakening demand, and increasing competition from legacy automakers affected Tesla’s sales. Some analysts and retail shareholders agree that Musk’s takeover of Twitter and subsequent antics have not helped Tesla, either. Tesla shareholders vs. Twitter Shareholders pinned Tesla’s stock price and success on Elon Musk’s company governance. They felt his seeming laser focus on all aspects of Tesla made the company successful and profitable. However, Musk’s purchase of Twitter drew him away from the day-to-day operations of Tesla as he tried to recover from his rash decision to buy the social media giant. The deal, completed in late October 2022, saw Musk putting most of his focus on the platform instead of Tesla. Musk’s purchase of Twitter Tesla stock began the year on a high but ended about 65% lower at the end of the year. This precipitous drop in value saw prominent shareholders call for Musk’s return to his duties at Tesla and to leave Twitter alone. Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, tweeted, \"Tesla stock price now reflects the value of having no CEO.\" Musk’s response was less than gracious. Many longtime Tesla shareholders have made similar statements to Musk on Twitter and elsewhere. It is important to know that the market as a whole was down in 2022. The technology-heavy NASDAQwas down close to 33% as investors sold off high-growth stocks over looming recession fears. Many other investor favorites were down significantly in 2022, including Amazon, which was down 51%, and Meta, down 64%. From Tesla Fans to Tesla Haters Musk’s unrestrained commentary on Twitter has cost him a substantial portion of his fans and customer base. Many Tesla buyers are center-left Democrats, and Musk has been making statements about favoring far-right policies on Twitter. Tesla’s traditional customer base is making their feelings public about buying a car from someone they feel is a hypocrite since the far-right ideology is more in line with ignoring the industrial impact on the climate than finding ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Buyers who once lauded Musk’s revolutionary electric vehicles are turning away from Tesla. They have no problem voicing their feelings as they trade-in or sell their vehicles. In turn, legacy automakers are delivering all-electric cars to the market in 2023 and using over 100 years of experience building finished cars with minimal quality issues. EV buyers now have multiple makes and models to choose from. multiple makes and models Tesla is moving forward with its plans to build more gigafactories and expand existing ones. It filed to expand its gigafactory in Texas in early 2023 and is seeking to build a plant in Indonesia and Mexico. An expansion of the gigafactory in China is on hold. The Texas gigafactory is handling expanded production of the Model Y and will also be the site of production for the Cybertruck. Tesla’s Cybertruck is expected to enter early production in the middle of 2023 and reach normal production levels by the end of the year. There are rumors Tesla will start producing a new model that starts at $25,000 in 2023, which could boost sales if customers put deposits down to reserve the car. In late 2022, the company began to roll out its semi-truck, which should also help increase sales. Finally, with the reduction in production, Tesla is hoping that its major loss in stock value has generated interest among buyers who feel the stock is value-priced. With above-average growth expected for the company in the coming years, the current stock price is seen as a bargain, which has fueled the increase in stock price. The stock has recovered about 20% of its value during the first two weeks of 2023, but it remains to be seen how well Tesla will perform in the coming months and if Musk has learned his lesson about arguing with people on Twitter. After a rough 2022, Tesla stock has rebounded nicely so far in 2023. Time will tell if the rally in stock price is a short-term event due to a fair valuation or if investors will overlook some of the near-term issues with the automaker and keep pushing the stock price higher.

       "  'text': 'Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Elon Musk Said Tesla Buyout Plan Didn’t Involve ‘a Specific Number’ Under questioning, Mr. Musk said he hadn’t discussed how much money investors would put in to help him take his car company private. As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Kalley Huang and Peter Eavis Kalley Huang reported from the federal court in San Francisco and Peter Eavis reported from New York. Under direct questioning by a federal judge on Tuesday, Elon Musk could not say exactly how much money investors were considering putting into his 2018 proposal to take Tesla off the stock market. Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter on Aug. 7, 2018, that he had “funding secured” for the deal. But during his last day of testimony in a trial in San Francisco, he acknowledged that individuals and investment funds he had discussed his plan with had not indicated the amounts they were willing to invest in the deal. “Not a specific number,” Mr. Musk replied after the judge, Edward M. Chen, told him that he had to answer “yes or no” when asked whether dollar amounts had been discussed. Judge Chen asked Mr. Musk the question at least twice, intervening after Mr. Musk did not clearly answer questions posed by a lawyer for the investors suing him and Tesla, Nicholas Porritt. When Mr. Porritt again asked whether any investors had committed to specific amounts, Mr. Musk said he was willing to include the large number of Tesla shares he owned in the deal. “I mean, I certainly have myself.” Mr. Musk, who testified for seven hours over three days, and his legal team have argued that funding for the deal was in fact plentiful while adding that it was difficult to come up with exact amounts until it was clear how much money was needed to buy out shareholders who didn’t want to be part of the deal. The investors bringing the case say they suffered billions of dollars of losses after Tesla’s stock rose in response to Mr. Musk’s statements about taking the company private but then fell when the proposal went nowhere. Judge Chen has already ruled that two of Mr. Musk’s posts on Twitter were false and that he was reckless in publishing them. But the investors must show that the false statements, and not other statements from Mr. Musk or other factors, led to their losses. Mr. Musk, wearing a dark suit, a black surgical mask and combat boots, entered the courtroom and watched jurors walk to their seats. He tried to minimize the importance of the plaintiffs, telling Mr. Porritt that, “in my opinion, you don’t represent” most investors. Judge Chen described these comments as “inappropriate” and struck them from the court’s record. Mr. Musk also tried to say most Tesla investors are happy because the company is worth more now than it was in 2018 — another statement that Judge Chen removed from the court’s record. Two of Mr. Musk’s lawyers threw up their hands and shook their heads. In testimony on Monday, Mr. Musk maintained that he had not lied or misspoken about his plan to take Tesla private because executives at Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had expressed interest in the deal, even though they had not signed documents committing to it or discussed how much they would invest. He said “funding secured” had also referred to his stake in SpaceX, the rocket company he runs, because he could have borrowed against those shares or sold some of them. On Friday, Mr. Musk acknowledged that he provided important information about Tesla on his Twitter account and that it had to follow rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission. But he said his social media posts did not necessarily cause swings in Tesla’s share price. In 2018, Mr. Musk and Tesla settled a separate lawsuit with the S.E.C. about his plan to take Tesla private. They paid fines to the S.E.C., and Mr. Musk agreed to resign as Tesla’s chairman and to allow a lawyer to review some statements about Tesla before he posted them on social media.

If Tesla hits that revenue estimate, it’ll mark a record for the company, but also the slowest pace of growth since mid-2020. As usual, Tesla will share its results Wednesday after market close, and management will discuss the earnings and answer analyst questions during a webcast that will he held at 5:30 p.m. ET. The automaker is closing out a tumultuous year in which its stock price fell 65% due to factors ranging from CEO Elon Musk’s distraction with Twitter to fears over slowing sales in a pandemic-affected China. Tesla is expected to address these concerns, as well as its recent vehicle price cuts and missed Q4 delivery estimates, during the call tomorrow. missed Q4 delivery estimates In fact, so much has happened over the last few months in Tesla-land that Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the upcoming earnings call and guidance commentary will be “one of the most important moments in the history of Tesla and for Musk himself.” Before we dive into our expectations for the call, let’s note that Tesla shares closed Tuesday at $143.89, rallying more than 30% since earlier this month after shedding two-thirds of its value from April 2022. Musk doesn’t always join Tesla’s earnings calls — and is in fact currently busy defending himself in court over claims that he defrauded investors with his infamous 2018 “funding secured” tweet — but the CEO is expected to make an appearance tomorrow, if only to assuage investor fears that he’s not giving Tesla enough of his attention since taking over Twitter. The executive also went to trial in November to defend his $56 billion Tesla pay package after a shareholder filed suit to rescind the deal, which he said was given unjustly to Musk, a “part-time CEO.” $56 billion Tesla pay package During Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk promised Tesla would deliver an “epic end of year.” The automaker set record vehicle sales and deliveries, but still missed its own and Wall Street estimates. In part fueled by last-minute discounts to Model Y and 3 vehicles in December, Tesla delivered 405,278 vehicles in the fourth quarter. The street had expected anywhere from 420,000 to 425,000 units to be delivered. Analysts will likely question the company on its misses, as Q4 marked the third quarter in a row that the automaker didn’t make it to as many deliveries as it promised. Tesla might be called on to provide more realistic estimates for 2023. We might also see updated delivery and sales numbers for the fourth quarter when earnings are released. Margins on vehicle price cuts Earlier this month, Tesla lowered the price of its long-range Model Y crossover (20% to $52,990) and Model 3 sedan (14% to $53,990) for U.S. buyers. The new, lower base price of the vehicles qualifies them for the $7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August. Under the terms of the IRA, the threshold for electric sedans is $55,000 and for SUVs, pickup trucks and vans is $80,000. Tesla also lowered the prices of its Model S sedan and Model X, which are still too expensive to qualify for the EV tax credit. The most recent price slashes mark at least the fourth time the automaker has discounted its vehicles or offered credits in the past several months. Tesla announced price cuts in China up to 9% on the Model 3 and Model Y in October, reducing prices further by nearly 14% earlier this month. The company also issued first a $3,750 discount for Model Y and 3s in the U.S. and Canada in early December, before kicking it up to $7,500 later in the month. Tesla announced price cuts Investors have not taken kindly to the price cuts, which they feared signaled a dip in demand for the iconic EVs. However, the price cuts seem to have in fact boosted demand for the vehicles. What investors will be hoping to gauge is whether the price cuts have cut too significantly into Tesla’s margins. It might be too early to have those answers, but Tesla will likely provide some guidance. Updates on new gigafactories Tesla announced Tuesday plans to invest $3.6 billion more into its gigafactory in Nevada, adding two new facilities dedicated to building battery cells and Tesla Semis. The automaker might discuss these plans further, such as when they hope to break ground on the facilities and start production. $3.6 billion more into its gigafactory in Nevada The automaker has said it has a multi-year plan to boost production by 50%, so analysts will want to hear about other new gigafactories. There have been reports that Tesla is planning a $10 billion gigafactory in Mexico, and the company is getting close to a deal to build factories in Indonesia, as well. $10 billion gigafactory in Mexico More on the Semi and Cybertruck Tesla finally revealed in December its first production versions of the long-delayed electric Semi, handing over the first few of Pepsi’s order of 100 trucks, which the company ordered back in 2017. A number of high-profile companies, including Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi, Walmart and UPS, also reserved Semis, so we might get some updates on production and when those companies can expect deliveries. Pepsi’s order of 100 trucks Tesla’s Cybertruck has also suffered multiple delays, but Musk said in July that the company was on track to launch the truck toward the middle of this year. We’re expecting further updates on timing, as well as new features. In September, Musk said the Cybertruck would be “waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat.” Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes isn’t headed to jail tomorrow after all The D’Amelio family won’t buy TikTok, but they thought about it Beloved hacking veteran Kelly ‘Aloria’ Lum passes away at 41 VCs should want to hold early-stage companies more accountable TechCrunch DisruptSept 19-21 San Francisco, CA How AI helps fintechs enrich the customer journey NVIDIA and AWS See all newsletters(opens in a new window) See all newsletters(opens in a new window) twitter(opens in a new window) facebook(opens in a new window) linkedin(opens in a new window) reddit(opens in a new window) mail(opens in a new window) Big factories, big trucks and big Musk: Tesla Q4 earnings expectations Big factories, big trucks and big Musk: Tesla Q4 earnings expectations Elon Musk will likely testify about his Autopilot statements Elon Musk will likely testify about his Autopilot statements Meta says time spent on Instagram grew 24% thanks to TikTok-style AI Reel recommendations Meta says time spent on Instagram grew 24% thanks to TikTok-style AI Reel recommendations Daily Crunch: Lookout sells consumer security segment for $223M to become ‘pure-play enterprise company’ Daily Crunch: Lookout sells consumer security segment for $223M to become ‘pure-play enterprise company’ Meta beats revenue expectations, remains committed to metaverse Meta beats revenue expectations, remains committed to metaverse Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes isn’t headed to jail tomorrow after all Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes isn’t headed to jail tomorrow after all Roku gains 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1, warns of continued ad uncertainty Roku gains 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1, warns of continued ad uncertainty Grubhub, Joco team up to give NYC delivery workers access to e-bikes Grubhub, Joco team up to give NYC delivery workers access to e-bikes Why ChatGPT lies in some languages more than others Why ChatGPT lies in some languages more than others YouTube Music contractors win historic union vote YouTube Music contractors win historic union vote Amazon closing Halo health division, lays off staff while offering hardware refunds Amazon closing Halo health division, lays off staff while offering hardware refunds Mark Cuban-backed streaming app Fireside confirms $25M Series A at $138M valuation Mark Cuban-backed streaming app Fireside confirms $25M Series A at $138M valuation Hackers are breaking into AT&T email accounts to steal cryptocurrency Hackers are breaking into AT&T email accounts to steal cryptocurrency Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai OpenSea’s next journey is to help Web 2.0 brands get into web3 OpenSea’s next journey is to help Web 2.0 brands get into web3 Revolut’s valuation troubles signal a stormy horizon for less-profitable neobanks Revolut’s valuation troubles signal a stormy horizon for less-profitable neobanks Google disrupts malware that steals sensitive data from Chrome users Google disrupts malware that steals sensitive data from Chrome users VinFast’s EV ambitions just got a $2.5B boost VinFast’s EV ambitions just got a $2.5B boost UK’s TympaHealth sounds out $23M to expand its hearing diagnostics startup UK’s TympaHealth sounds out $23M to expand its hearing diagnostics startup EU warns Twitter over disinformation after Musk policy shifts found to boost Kremlin propaganda EU warns Twitter over disinformation after Musk policy shifts found to boost Kremlin propaganda Instacart rolls out new ways for users to find deals on its app Instacart rolls out new ways for users to find deals on its app Ask Sophie: My STEM OPT expires in 30 days, what are my options?

Why it matters: One of the questions the jury is tasked with deciding is whether the Tesla CEO’s tweets were material — that is, significant information that could impact investor decisions. Catch up quick: The Tesla CEO is being sued by investors over his false 2018 tweet that he had secured funding to take the company private. What he’s saying: \"I expected that there [would] probably be some increase in the stock price — seems likely,\" he said, per the Financial Times. The big picture: Musk also testified that he posted the tweet because he was worried the Financial Times might publish information about his plans and wanted all Tesla shareholders to know that he was considering the transaction.

Tesla’s price cuts drag share prices sharply lower by: TOM KRISHER, Associated Press Posted: Apr 20, 2023 / 01:24 PM PDT Updated: Apr 20, 2023 / 01:29 PM PDT by: TOM KRISHER, Associated Press Posted: Apr 20, 2023 / 01:24 PM PDT Updated: Apr 20, 2023 / 01:29 PM PDT DETROIT (AP) — Tesla shares fell sharply Thursday as the company felt the sting of numerous price cuts it made across its model lineup this year in hopes of energizing sales. Tesla is shaving thousands of dollars off the price of its cars as American consumers pull back spending on big ticket items, anxious over elevated inflation and a pair of U.S. banks that collapsed during Tesla’s first quarter. Tesla’s sales did climb during the quarter, but the amount of money generated per sale fell on price cuts, and first-quarter profit slumped 24%, the company said late Wednesday. Shares of Tesla Inc. tumbled 9.8% after dropping 2% on Wednesday. They closed at $162.99, the lowest point since late January. The shares have rallied all year after a significant sell-off in 2022. TDCowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said he’s “concerned” about Tesla’s strategy of selling as many vehicles as possible at lower profit margins and counting on revenue generated later from “Full Self-Driving” technology. Osborne remains skeptical about when that technology will be available. “We continue to question whether FSD will ever work on a camera-only based system” with older hardware, Osborne wrote. Tesla made $2.51 billion from January through March, down from $3.32 billion a year ago. Revenue rose 24% to $23.33 billion, but the company’s operating profit margin fell. CEO Elon Musk hinted that price cuts may not be over. He told analysts that Tesla evaluates them daily and wants to keep producing the maximum number of vehicles possible. “Orders are in excess of production,” he said when asked what happened to orders since recent price cuts were announced. Early in the quarter Tesla reduced U.S. prices on many of its models, then did it a second time early in March. The company slashed U.S. prices two more times in April, including overnight Wednesday, in an effort to boost sales. It trimmed prices in Europe as well. The company produced nearly 18,000 more vehicles than it sold during the quarter, indicating softening demand. Tesla’s first-quarter operating margin fell from 19.2% in the first quarter of last year to 11.4% this quarter. Musk said Tesla wants to sell more vehicles at lower prices so it later can take in revenue from its $15,000 “Full Self-Driving” system that will turn cars into robotaxis and increase their value. Despite the name, the cars cannot drive themselves, and Tesla warns drivers that they have to be ready to intervene at all times. In 2019, Musk promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020, and he said early last year that the cars would be autonomous in 2022. Since 2021, Tesla has been using owners to beta test “Full Self-Driving” on public roads. But Tesla’s partially automated driving systems are coming under increasing scrutiny from U.S. safety regulators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has sent investigative teams to more than 30 crashes since 2016 in which Teslas suspected of operating on Autopilot or “Full Self-Driving” have struck pedestrians, motorcyclists, semi trailers and parked emergency vehicles. At least 14 people were killed in the crashes. In addition, NHTSA in February pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with “Full Self-Driving” software because the system can break traffic laws. The agency said in documents that the system can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane or going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution. The problems were to be fixed with an online software update. The Justice Department also has asked Tesla for documents about “Full Self-Driving” and Autopilot. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in the table as changes in names. In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value. Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently result in a cost basis of zero.

In addition to reporting standard equity and debt issues, institutions with more than 100MM assets under management must also disclose their put and call option holdings. Since put options generally indicate negative sentiment, and call options indicate positive sentiment, we can get a sense of the overall institutional sentiment by plotting the ratio of puts to calls. The chart to the right plots the historical put/call ratio for this instrument. Using Put/Call Ratio as an indicator of investor sentiment overcomes one of the key deficiencies of using total institutional ownership, which is that a significant amount of assets under management are invested passively to track indices. Passively-managed funds do not typically buy options, so the put/call ratio indicator more closely tracks the sentiment of actively-managed funds. © 2015-2023 Fintel Ventures LLC.

His exhaustive part-by-part cost analysis returned that it takes Tesla US$39,393 to make a Model Y, all the while it sold for US$58,990 on average, and even after the generous price cuts it dropped to $52,990, still a whopping gross profit. That same Model Y gross profits just rose to more than US$14,000 per vehicle as Tesla bumped its price back up to $53,490, as the cut brought demand back while forcing other EV makers into a price war that Tesla is likely to win, according to Mr Munro. His estimates say that due to the decreased production costs that Tesla says are behind its price cuts, as well as the manufacturing efficiencies stemming from the shift to newer Gigafactories or upgrades of existing ones, as well as added value services like the FSD subscriptions, Tesla can keep the unprecedented 40% margin even with the current lower prices. decreased production costs that Tesla says are behind its price cuts A number of EV manufacturers like Lucid, NIO, or XPeng, already announced price cuts immediately after Tesla changed the tags of its bestselling Model 3 and Model Y, and the rest are likely to follow. The issue is that no automaker has Tesla’s economies of scale and only the Chinese EV brands can compete in production costs due to the government’s multi-year strategy to develop and maintain a lead in raw materials refinement and battery production there. The rest are likely to face significant financial troubles while trying to catch up to Tesla’s margins and many could teeter on the verge of bankruptcy, says Munro. In the meantime, Tesla officials are already on record saying that the company’s top priority now is to expand into the mass vehicle market. Tesla may have even put performance projects like the Roadster 2 on the back burner in order to focus on \"mass electrification.\" This likely means spearheading the development of the smaller and cheaper Model 2 which Elon Musk tipped is likely to hit half the production cost of a Model 3. Roadster 2 on the back burner in order to focus on \"mass electrification.\" smaller and cheaper Model 2 Given Sandy Munro’s estimates that it cost Tesla about US$33,600 to make a Model 3 last year, the Model 2 could be priced close to US$25,000 and still bring Tesla the infamous US$10,000 average profit per vehicle, annihilating the competition in the process. Tesla will be reporting earnings tomorrow and analysts are expecting US$24.4 billion in revenue on 439,700 cars produced last quarter, or US$55,500 per vehicle whose average cost to produce is about US$36,000, a rather enviable margin.

REUTERS/Victoria KlestyReuters (Reuters) -Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it would invest more than $3.6 billion to expand its Nevada Gigafactory complex with two new factories, one to mass produce its long-delayed Semi electric truck and the other to make its new 4680 battery cell. The cell plant would be able to make enough batteries for 2 million light-duty vehicles annually, including batteries using the 4680-type cell. The 4680 is key to Tesla meeting a goal of halving battery costs and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030. Together, the facilities will employ about 3,000 people, extending the electric vehicle maker’s complex east of Reno, where it runs a battery joint venture with Japan’s Panasonic Corp and makes vehicle parts and power backup systems. Panasonic currently supplies cells to the gigafactory, and Tesla assembles them into battery packs there. Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the 4680 at its factories in Fremont, California, and Austin, Texas. Experts say the dry-coating technique used to produce the bigger cells in these batteries is new and unproven and the company has been having trouble scaling up manufacturing to the point where the big cost savings kick in. The move suggests Tesla is finally committing to large-scale production of the Semi, which was initially supposed to begin rolling out of factory doors in 2019. Tesla made the first Semi deliveries in December to PepsiCo but there is no sign of a high rate of output of the model. Other customers that have ordered Semis include Brewer Anheuser-Busch, United Parcel Service Inc and Walmart Inc. The Semi is a truck for 18-wheel semi-trailer vehicles and has a range of 500 miles (800 kilometers) on a single charge with a gross weight of 81,000 pounds (37 tonnes), including trailer and cargo. It may qualify for tax credits of $40,000 offered for clean commercial vehicles under the Inflation Reduction Act. Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said in November that Tesla might produce 100 Semis in 2022, but the company disclosed no figure for the model in its fourth-quarter production report. The EV maker aimed to produce 50,000 Semis in 2024, Musk said on a post-earnings call in October. Tesla’s Tuesday announcement \"is the latest in more than $300 billion in private sector investment in clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing announced since the President took office,\" Mitch Landrieu, senior advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden said.

Elon Musk arrives at federal court in New York City in 2019. “I thought I was doing the right thing,” Musk, who took the stand in San Francisco federal court at about 11:30 EST, testified Monday during cross-examination from his attorney Alex Spiro. He intended to make sure “all shareholders were aware of taking private and not just a few big shareholders,” Musk added, digging into his continued claim he intended to help retail investors, not to harm or mislead them, in disclosing the closed-door discussions about the buyout (public companies are supposed to disclose any non-material public information through the Securities and Exchange Commission). Though Musk stands by his sincere intentions, he has already landed in significant hot water for the take-private post: The SEC fined him and Tesla $10 million apiece and ordered Musk’s removal as chairman of Tesla’s board because Musk “knew that the potential transaction was uncertain” and his “misleading tweets caused…significant market disruption,” noting shares of the electric vehicle maker jumped 6% on the day of the tweet. \"I certainly never want an investor to lose money, and if [any investor] did lose money on the basis of that tweet, then obviously I would be sad about that,\" Musk said near the conclusion of his testimony that ended at about 3 p.m. EST. AEW Dynamite Results:Winners And Grades With Tony Khan’s Huge Announcement The testimony comes as part of the high-profile civil lawsuit, seeking billions of dollars in damages, brought forward by a class of Tesla shareholders who say they lost money from the stock’s brief rise and subsequent fall after Musk’s August 7, 2018 tweet indicating he had “secured” funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Musk took the stand for about 30 minutes Friday and five hours Monday, with his defense largely centered on his belief that the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund had indeed committed enough capital to execute a buyout and his tweet was intended to inform all Tesla investors of the multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in the company before the Financial Times reported on the stake. Musk predictably had several colorful moments in court, testifying that the $420 share price was purely coincidental given the number’s connection to marijuana but indeed represented good “karma.” “JPMorgan hates Tesla, in a nutshell,” Musk testified Tuesday about the bitter public feud between Musk and Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of JPMorgan Chase. The U.S.’ largest bank sued its one-time client in November 2021 for $162 million.

       "  'text': 'The Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (TSLL) and Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares (TSLS) seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 150% and 100% of the inverse (or opposite), respectively, of the performance of the common shares of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day.

The Funds do not seek to achieve their stated investment objectives for a period of time other than a single trading day. The funds should not be expected to provide 150% or -100% of the returns of TSLA for periods greater than a day. Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures and sells electric vehicles and electric vehicle powertrain components. TSLA is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Information provided to or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Tesla, Inc. pursuant to the Exchange Act can be located by reference to the Securities and Exchange Commission file number 001- 34756 through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, information regarding Tesla, Inc. may be obtained from other sources including, but not limited to, press releases, newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents. Important Information Regarding TSLL The Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (TSLL) seeks 150% daily leveraged investment results and thus will have an increase of volatility relative to the underlying TSLA performance itself. Longer holding periods, higher volatility of TSLA and leverage increase the impact of compounding on an investor’s returns. During periods of higher TSLA volatility, the volatility of TSLA may affect the fund’s performance. Important Information Regarding TSLS The Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares (TSLS) seeks daily inverse investment results and is very different from most other exchange-traded funds. Longer holding periods and higher volatility of TSLA increase the impact of compounding on an investor’s returns. During periods of higher volatility, the volatility of TSLA may affect the fund’s return as much as, or more than, the return of TSLA. NAV and Market Price information as of April 25, 2023.

Under the Operating Expense Limitation Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to waive all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2024, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s average daily net assets (excluding, as applicable, among other expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses).

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns.

Tesla Investing Risk — The trading price of TSLA has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Tesla, Inc. Risk — The future growth and success of Tesla, Inc. are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles, and specifically, its vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile. If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla, Inc. vehicles does not develop as Tesla, Inc. expects, develops more slowly than it expects, or if demand for its vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, the business, prospects, financial condition and operating results of Tesla, Inc. may be harmed. Tesla, Inc. may fail to meet its publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of TSLA to decline significantly. Automotive Companies Risk — The automotive industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the industry may suffer periodic operating losses. Automotive companies can be significantly affected by labor relations, fluctuating component prices and supplier disruptions. Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in each Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund’s investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning. Risks of the Funds include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Leverage Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Correlation Risk, Tesla, Inc. Investing Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, Trading Halt Risk, Cash Transaction Risk, Tax Risk, and risks specific to the consumer discretionary sector, electric and autonomous vehicles companies, and automotive companies. Additional risks include, for the Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares, risks related to Shorting.

Furthermore, the Funds cannot give any assurance that all events occurring prior to the date hereof (including events that would affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents described above) that would affect the trading price of Apple Inc. have been publicly disclosed. Subsequent disclosure of any such events or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning Apple Inc. could affect the value of a Fund’s investments with respect to Apple Inc. and therefore the value of the Funds. Technology Sector Risk — The market prices of technology related securities tend to exhibit a greater degree of market risk and sharp price fluctuations than other types of securities. These securities may fall in and out of favor with investors rapidly, which may cause sudden selling and dramatically lower market prices. Technology securities may be affected by intense competition, obsolescence of existing technology, general economic conditions and government regulation and may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies may experience dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel. These companies are also heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely impact a company’s profitability. Apple Inc. Investing Risk — In addition to the risks associated with companies in the technology sector, Apple Inc. faces risks related to the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic; managing the frequent introductions and transitions of products and services; the outsourced manufacturing and logistical services provided by partners, many of which are located outside of the United States. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment held by the Fund to be more volatile than the market generally. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. Direxion Shares Risks – An investment in each Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Each Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with a Fund concentrating its investments in a particular security, industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. A Fund’s investments in derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other investments, including imperfect correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility and lack of availability. As a result, the value of an investment in a Fund may change quickly and without warning. Risks of the Funds include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Leverage Risk, Derivatives Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Correlation Risk, Apple Inc. Investing Risk, Market Risk, Industry Concentration Risk, Indirect Investment Risk, Trading Halt Risk, Cash Transaction Risk, Tax Risk, and risks specific to the technology sector. Additional risks include, for the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares, risks related to Shorting. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Funds.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day Direxion Launches Google Single Stock Leveraged ETFs Are Leveraged ETFs right for you?

The funds should not be expected to provide 150% or -100% of the returns of GOOGL for periods greater than a day. Alphabet Inc. provides online advertising services in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Latin America. The company offers performance and brand advertising services. GOOGL is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Information provided to or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Alphabet Inc. pursuant to the Exchange Act can be located by reference to the Securities and Exchange Commission file number 001- 37580 through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, information regarding Alphabet Inc. may be obtained from other sources including, but not limited to, press releases, newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents. Important Information Regarding GGLL The Direxion Daily GOOGL Bull 1.5X Shares (GGLL) seeks 150% daily leveraged investment results and thus will have an increase of volatility relative to the underlying GOOGL performance itself. Longer holding periods, higher volatility of GOOGL and leverage increase the impact of compounding on an investor’s returns. During periods of higher GOOGL volatility, the volatility of GOOGL may affect the fund’s performance. Important Information Regarding GGLS The Direxion Daily GOOGL Bear 1X Shares (GGLS) seeks daily inverse investment results and is very different from most other exchange-traded funds. Longer holding periods and higher volatility of GOOGL increase the impact of compounding on an investor’s returns. During periods of higher volatility, the volatility of GOOGL may affect the fund’s return as much as, or more than, the return of GOOGL. NAV and Market Price information as of April 25, 2023.

If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%. The Fund’s adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”), has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund. Under the Operating Expense Limitation Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to waive all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2024, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s average daily net assets (excluding, as applicable, among other expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses). If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher. The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
